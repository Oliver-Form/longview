I really want to be able to program any type of run on the app.

A logical way of structuring it is like hevy workouts. Yes, hevy workouts.

A list of exercises, where an exercise has different attributes.

running_distance - distance, pace_class, goal_pace, achieved_pace
walking_distance - distance, time_achieved
running_time - time, pace_class, goal_distance, achieved_distance
walking_time - time, distance_achieved

hills - hill height, hill length

waiting - time
